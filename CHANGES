v1.0.0 (xx Dec 2013)
  Improved speed calculation with an exponential moving average. The speed
      should be more stable without losing too much accuracy.

    is now returned as an argument of the "render" function.
  The "render" function is now mandatory.

    unpipes the stream.

  Renamed options:
    "write" to "render".
    "barCompletion" to "progressBarComplete".
